#What is pygame
'''Pygame is a Python library designed for creating 2D games and
multimedia applications.
It provides functionalities for handling graphics, sounds, and user inputs in an
easy-to-use framework.'''

#Configuration
'''To install Pygame, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install pygame
Explanation of Basic Functions:
pygame.init():

Initializes all imported Pygame modules. This is required before using Pygameâ€™s functionalities like rendering graphics, handling input, etc.
pygame.display.set_mode():

Sets up the game window's width and height, returning a Surface object that represents the screen.
pygame.display.set_caption():

Sets the title of the game window.
pygame.event.get():

Gets a list of all events (keyboard, mouse, window events, etc.) that have happened since the last loop iteration.
pygame.QUIT:

This event is triggered when the player clicks the close button on the game window.
screen.fill():

Fills the screen with a solid color. (0, 0, 0) represents black in RGB color values.
pygame.display.flip():

Updates the contents of the entire display to the screen. This is necessary to reflect any drawing or updates.
pygame.time.Clock():

Manages the frame rate (FPS). By calling clock.tick(60), you ensure the game runs at 60 frames per second.
pygame.quit():

Uninitializes all Pygame modules. This is necessary to clean up resources when exiting the game.
sys.exit():

Ensures the program exits cleanly after quitting Pygame.
This setup is the foundation for building more complex games using Pygame.'''
