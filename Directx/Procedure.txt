Step 1: Create a New Project in Visual Studio
Open Visual Studio.
Create a new project:
Language: Select C#.
Application Type: Choose Windows Forms Application.
.NET Framework Version: Select .NET Framework 2.0.
Name your project and choose a location.
Note: If .NET Framework 2.0 is not installed, you might need to download and install it.


Step 2: Configure the Build Platform
After creating the project, go to Project Properties:
Click on the Project tab in the menu, then click Properties.
In the Build section:
Set Platform Target to x86 (32-bit) to ensure compatibility with DirectX libraries.
This ensures the program runs in 32-bit mode, which is required for the DirectX components.


Step 3: Open Form1 Code
In the Solution Explorer, find Form1.
Right-click on Form1 and select View Code. This will open the code editor for Form1.cs.


Step 4: Add DirectX References
In the Solution Explorer, right-click on your project name and select Add Reference.
In the reference window:
Click on Browse and navigate to the following path:
makefile
Copy code
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\DirectX for Managed Code\1.0.2902.0
Select the following DLL files:
Microsoft.DirectX.dll
Microsoft.DirectX.Direct3D.dll
Microsoft.DirectX.Direct3DX.dll
Add these files to your project as references.


Step 5: Attach the Paint Event Handler
In Form1's Properties window, go to the Events section.
Find the Paint event and double-click it to automatically generate the event handler Form1_Paint.
This will create the necessary Paint event handler in the Form1.cs file.


Step 6: Initialize Direct3D in the Code
In Form1.cs, add the following code for setting up Direct3D:
This code sets up the Direct3D device and handles the basic rendering in the Form1_Paint event. The screen will be cleared with a blue background.


Step 7: Handle LoaderLock Exception
When running the code, you might encounter a LoaderLock exception. To resolve this:
Go to Debug > Windows > Exception Settings.
Find Managed Debugging Assistants.
Uncheck the LoaderLock option.
This will prevent the LoaderLock exception from being thrown.


Step 8: Run the Program
Build and Run the project.
You should see a blue window, indicating that the Direct3D device has been initialized and is rendering correctly.
